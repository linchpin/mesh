## What is Mesh?

Mesh is the easiest way to add additional content to your Page, Post, or 
Custom Post Type in a responsive grid system. Adding a Mesh Section creates
 a new row on your page below the default WordPress content. Each Section can
 be divided into 1 to 4 Columns, providing Visual/Text editors for each Column.
 Give your Sections and Columns titles, drag to rearrange, add background
 images to Columns or an entire Section, then Publish your Section or save it
 as a Draft until your content is just right.

Efficient and unobtrusive, Mesh was designed to simply extend the functionality
 of the normal page editor within WordPress to provide the flexibility of
 building pages in a responsive grid without adding code or editing page
 templates.

#### Responsive Out-of-the-Box

Mesh is currently utilizes [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com)'s grid but
 will soon have support for Bootstrap and custom frameworks as well. All grid
 styles can also be easily disabled.

#### Familiar and Easy to Use

Our goal is to stay as close to the core usability of WordPress as possible. 
Mesh content editing is recognizable and simple to use. As you create new
 Sections for your content you will be presented with an interface similar
 to that utilized on default Pages and Posts.

#### Extensible and Plays Well with Others

We have a library of hooks to extend the functionality of Mesh and will
 continue to expand these over time. For a full list of currently available
 hooks and filters is available within [Hooks and filters](https://meshplugin.com/knowledgebase_category/hooks-filters/)

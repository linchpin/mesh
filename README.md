# Mesh - Page Builder #

A page builder, simplified. Get the most flexibility to display content by adding multiple content sections within Pages, Posts, or Custom Post Types.

## Description ##

This plugin is deprecated and no longer actively maintained excluding any security updates. The Block Editor/Gutenberg can handle many aspects of row and column content that this plugin provides.

If you still would like to utilize this plugin you need to additionally install the classic-editor plugin as mesh *is not* compatible with the block editor

Page, Post, or Custom Post Type in a responsive grid system. Adding a Mesh Section creates a new row on your page below the default WordPress content. Each Section can be divided into 1 to 4 Columns, providing Visual/Text editors for each Column. Give your Sections and Columns titles, drag to rearrange, add background images to Columns or an entire Section, then Publish your Section or save it as a Draft until your content is just right.

Efficient and unobtrusive, Mesh was designed to simply extend the functionality of the normal page editor within WordPress to provide the flexibility of building pages in a responsive grid without adding code or editing page templates.

### Responsive Out-of-the-Box ###
Mesh is currently built off of [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/)'s grid but will soon have support for Bootstrap and custom frameworks as well. All grid styles can also be easily disabled.

### Familiar and Easy to Use ###
Our goal is to stay as close to the core usability of WordPress as possible. Mesh Content editing is recognizable and simple to use. As you create new Sections for your content you will be presented with an interface similar to that utilized on default Pages and Posts.

### Extensible and Plays Well with Others ###
We have added a few hooks to extend the functionality of Mesh and will continue to expand these over time. For a full list of currently available hooks and filters check out the FAQ.
